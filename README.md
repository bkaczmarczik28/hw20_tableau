Homework 20 on tableau

HW20 Tableau uses data from https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data. This homework assignment presents the story of bike use in the Jersey City area of New York City from 2017 to 2019 in the months of June and December.

This repository stores the original data sets and juptyer notebook used to merge the datasets.

Analysis of the Data:

The tableau story was put together to help identify any noticable trends or questionable outliers in the data. For the most part, the data makes sense at a fundamental level. Use of bikes is more prominent in the summer over the winter, which would follow an obvious assumption people prefer to ride outside during warmer weather. 

Use of the bikes is high during rush hour, which once again would be an obvious observation, because people are always in need of transportation to get to work. It implies people rely on the Citi Bikes more for transportation rather then recreation. 

One trend that isn't evident, but existed in the data was the strong discrepancy of the bike use between genders. Men used the bikes around 3 times more often then women. 

Another unique note to make of the data is the spike in bike use for riders who are 51 years old. Due to how the majority of these 51 year old users identify as "Unknown" for their gender, it would seem there is a group of outliers or suspicious use of the bikes. 

Understanding the relationship between trip duration and distance was cumbersome, due to the fact there were numerous bike uses that lasted for an extensive period of time (well over a day). Filtering the data down to bike trips that only lasted less then a day provided a less cumbersome dataset to analyze. 

See tableau for additional takeaways from the dataset.
